# Nobel Prize winners

This project makes it possible to discover the history Nobel Prize winners. This is done through two interactive timelines as well as filter functions and pop-up windows. At the top of the website you will find the filter functions, below the first time axis, with which you can quickly switch between decades, and below the second axis, with which you can precisely select the desired year. The application automatically provides the desired results, each time the year changes or a filter option is changed. If one clicks on the results, a pop-up window with additional information appears. An additional pop-up window is displayed when a user arrives on the website or clicks the "About" button in the footer. This shows information on how to use the application.
